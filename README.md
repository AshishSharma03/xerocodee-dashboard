# XeroCodee Dashboard

## Overview

This project leverages various technologies and libraries to achieve its goals:

- **Next.js**: Used for building the frontend of the application.
- **Next-auth**: Implemented for authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
- **Redis (via @upstash/redis)**: Utilized as a data store for caching and other data-related tasks.
- **Axios**: Employed for making HTTP requests to external services or APIs.
- **bcryptjs**: Ensures secure password hashing and verification.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
- **Mongoose**: Enables interaction with MongoDB for database operations.
- **Nodemailer**: Provides email sending capabilities within the application.
- **React**: Used for building the user interface.
- **React-dom**: Handles rendering React components in the DOM.
- **React-icons**: Used to incorporate icons into the user interface.

### Approch 
-- NA

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your environment variables, if any are needed.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Usage

## Authentication

This project uses Next-auth for authentication and Redis for Single Sign-On (SSO). Make sure to configure your authentication and SSO settings properly.

## Improvements

Due to some technical issues with the SSO implementation, here are some areas for improvement in the project:

1. **SSO Troubleshooting**: Document the specific SSO issues encountered and any steps taken to address them. Consider reaching out to the relevant libraries or communities for assistance.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling and user feedback when SSO-related errors occur. Provide clear error messages and guidance for users.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track SSO-related issues in real-time. Tools like Sentry or Datadog can be valuable for this purpose.

4. **Documentation**: Enhance the project's documentation to include troubleshooting guides and FAQs related to SSO problems. This can help both users and contributors.

5. **Testing**: Expand your test suite to cover various SSO scenarios and edge cases. Automated testing can help identify and prevent SSO-related issues early in the development process.

6. **Version Updates**: Ensure that you are using the latest versions of SSO-related libraries and dependencies. Periodically check for updates and consider upgrading to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.
